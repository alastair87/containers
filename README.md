# Containers

A library of Ubuntu LTS based containers with basic dev utilities and my shell config. For quickly spinning up a dev environment on an unfamiliar machine e.g. to get an an Ubuntu environment on a non-Ubuntu host, a pre-configured environment in WSL2, on Mac not server deployment.

Basically this should be nicer than just trying to use an off-the-shelf Ubuntu container as your environment - the trade-off is that it's bigger.
